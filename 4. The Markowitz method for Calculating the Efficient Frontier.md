# The Markowitz method for Calculating the Efficient Frontier

The efficient frontier is derived by maximizing expected return for a given risk. Markowitz (1952) solved this problem mathematically. Four scenarios arise when wanting to calculate the efficient frontier:
- Short sales are allowed and risk free rate for borrowing/lending is available
- Short sales are allowed and risk free rate for borrowing/lending is not available
- Short sales are not allowed and risk free rate for borrowing/lending is available
- Short sales are not allowed and risk free rate for borrowing/lending is not available either

The efficient frontier is obtained by finding the tangency point between the transformation line and the minimum variance frontier. The slope of the transformation line is called the sharpe ratio, which is a measure of excess return to total risk. The tangency point occurs at the optimum portfolio.
