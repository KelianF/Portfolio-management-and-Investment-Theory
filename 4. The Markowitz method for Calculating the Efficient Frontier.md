# The Markowitz method for Calculating the Efficient Frontier

The efficient frontier is derived by maximizing expected return for a given risk. Markowitz (1952) solved this problem mathematically. Four scenarios arise when wanting to calculate the efficient frontier:
- Short sales are allowed and risk free rate for borrowing/lending is available
- Short sales are allowed and risk free rate for borrowing/lending is not available
- Short sales are not allowed and risk free rate for borrowing/lending is available
- Short sales are not allowed and risk free rate for borrowing/lending is not available either

The efficient frontier is obtained by finding the tangency point between the transformation line and the minimum variance frontier. The slope of the transformation line is called the sharpe ratio, which is a measure of excess return to total risk. The tangency point occurs at the optimum portfolio.

Mathematically, the Full MArkowitz technique for calculating the efficient frontier maximize the slope (Sharpe) of the transformation line subject to the constraint that the weights add to one.

Thus choose optimal ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?X_i)  to:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Max\frac{E(R_p)-R_f}{\sigma_p})

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?s.t.\sum^{N}_{i=1}X_i=1)


In matrix form:
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Omega.z=e)

with:
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Omega)  The variance, covariance Matrix

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z)  Column vector of optimal weights

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?e)  Column vector of excess returns


Folowing this, the solution is given as:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z=\Omega^{-1}e)


Inn 1998 Lewis includes two assumptions:
- Investors' utility depends on expected return and risk.
- Investors' maximize utility subject to the optimal transformation line.

Hence her solution is as follow:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z=\frac{1}{RRA}\Omega^{-1}e)

with RRA the coefficient of relative risk aversion.


This was in case short selling and a risk free rate were available.

In the case there is no short sell, but risk free rate is available:

The formula will be similar, with the extra constraint that the weights are non negative.

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Max\frac{R_p-R_f}{\sigma_p})

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?s.t.\sum^{N}_{i=1}X_i=1)

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?X_i>0)

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\forall:i=1,N)

In the case of No short sale nor risk free rate:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Max\frac{R_p}{\sigma_p})

given the same restrictions as before.
