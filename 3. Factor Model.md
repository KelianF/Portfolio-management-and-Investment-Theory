# Factor Model


There are three equations to understand by now:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?E(R_p)=\sum^N_{i=1}X_iE(R_i))

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\sigma_p^2=\sum^N_{i=1}X^2_i\sigma^2_i+\sum^N_{i=1}\sum^N_{\substack{j=1\\jâ‰ i}}X_iX_j\sigmai\sigma_j\rho_ij)

 ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\sum^N_{i=1}X_i=1)
 
 Those 3 equations are required to calculate the percentage invested in the portfolios on the efficient frontier.
 In order to derive the efficient frontier we maximize the first one subject to the second and third.
 If short sales are not allowed, another constraint exist: ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?X_i>0).

## The single index model

A single index model assumes that co-movement (or correlation) among asset is due to a single or common influence in the market. This suggests that asset returns might be related to the return on the market, which is reflected by the return on a broad stock market index.

The main uses of a single index model are for evaluating risk on a portfolio using Beta and for inputs in portfolio analysis.

The single index model is as follow:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?R_{it}=\alpha_i+\beta_iR_{mt}+\epsilon_{it})

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\epsilon_{it}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_{\epsiloni}))

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Cov(\epsilon_{it}R_{mt}=0))

This is often called the market model.

The return of such model is:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?E(R)=\alpha+\betaE(R))

The Variance of the returns is:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\sigma^2=E[R-E(R)]^2)

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?=E[((\alpha+\betaR+\epsilon)-(\alpha+\betaE(R))]^2))

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?=E[(\beta(R-E(R))+\epsilon)]^2)

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?=\beta^2\sigma^2_m+\sigma^2_{\epsilon})

= market risk + individual risk


## Characteristics of the single index model

The treynor ratio:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{R_i-R_f}{\beta_i})

The alpha of the portfolio is simply the weighted average of the alpha's on the individual assets that make up the portfolio:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\alpha_p=\sum^N_{i=1}X_i\slpha_i)

The beta on a portfolio is, similarly, the weighted average of the beta's of the individual's asset within the portfolio:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\beta_p=\sum^N_{i=1}X_i\beta_i)

## Blume's adjustment method:

Model:  ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\beta_2=a+b\beta_1+u)

Blume suggested one should calculate beta in two adjacent time periods (for example 1990-1994 and 1995-99), regress the estimated beta from period 2 on period 1 and use the estimated regression equation to forecast beta for period 3 (2000-04 for example).


## Vasicek adjustment method:

Vasicek also sugjested one should calculate beta in two adjacent time periods. The adjustment method in not a regression but a weighted average of the average historical beta on all asset =s and the historical beta on asset i.

model:  ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?B_2=(\frac{\sigma^2_{\beta_1}}{\sigma^2_{\beta_{market}}+\sigma^2_{\beta_1}})\beta_1+(\frac{\sigma^2_{beta_1}}{\sigma^2_{\beta_{market}}+\sigma^2_{\beta_1}})\beta_1)
